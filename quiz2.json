    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of an `if-else` statement?",
      "options": [
        "A) To execute a block of code repeatedly.",
        "B) To define a variable with a condition.",
        "C) To make decisions and execute one of two code blocks based on a condition.",
        "D) To stop the program execution."

      "question": "What is the output of the following code? `int x = 5; if (x = 0) { printf(\"True\"); } else { printf(\"False\"); }`",
      "options": [
        "A) True",
        "B) False",

      "correct_option": 1,
      "time_limit": 90,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "explanation": "The assignment operator `=` is used instead of the comparison operator `==`. The expression `x = 0` assigns 0 to x and evaluates to 0 (false), so the else block is executed.",
      "language": "C"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which statement is true about the `switch` statement in C?",
      "options": [
        "A) It only works with floating-point values.",
        "B) A `switch` must always have a `default` case.",
        "C) If a `break` is omitted, execution 'falls through' to the next case.",
        "D) `case` labels can have duplicate values."

      "question": "The ternary operator `? :` is a shorthand for which statement?",
      "options": [
        "A) for loop",
        "B) while loop",
        "C) if-else statement",

      ],
      "correct_option": 0,
      "time_limit": 120,
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "explanation": "This demonstrates short-circuit evaluation. Since `a > 10` is false, the second part of the AND condition (`b++ > 5`) is never evaluated. Thus, `b` remains 10.",
      "language": "C"

      "correct_option": 2,
      "time_limit": 90,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "explanation": "Without `break` statements, the switch case `2` is executed, and it 'falls through', executing all subsequent cases including `case 3` and `default`.",

      "correct_option": 2,
      "time_limit": 75,
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "explanation": "The expression in a switch statement must evaluate to an integral or character type. Floats and doubles are not allowed.",

      "explanation": "`x > 5` (3 > 5) is false (0). The logical NOT `!` operator inverts it to true (1).",
